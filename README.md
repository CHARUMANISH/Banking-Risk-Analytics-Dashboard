# Banking Risk Analytics Dashboard

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing banking and loan data to identify high-risk applicants using Python, SQL, and Power BI.  
The goal is to support data-driven decision-making for financial institutions by providing clear risk metrics and insights.

## Problem Statement
Banks deal with large volumes of customer and loan data.  
Identifying high-risk profiles early helps reduce defaults and improve portfolio quality.

## Dataset
- Simulated / anonymized banking loan dataset
- Size: 10,000+ customer records
- Key features include:
  - Customer demographics
  - Loan amount and tenure
  - Credit history indicators
  - Repayment behavior

## Approach
- Automated data ingestion and cleaning using Python
- SQL queries to compute risk metrics
- Statistical analysis to detect high-risk patterns
- Dashboard creation in Power BI for stakeholder visibility

## Key Insights
- Identified customer segments with higher default probability
- Highlighted correlations between loan tenure, income, and risk
- Enabled faster risk monitoring through automated pipelines

## Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- SQL
- Power BI

## Outcome
- Analyzed 10,000+ records efficiently
- Improved observability of risk metrics
- Provided actionable insights for product and risk teams

## Future Improvements
- Add machine learning models for credit risk prediction
- Integrate real-time data sources
- Deploy dashboard using cloud services
